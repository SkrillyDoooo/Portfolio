<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is William Jack. I'm a game developer. I spent the first 7 years of my career working for Unity Technologies where I had several roles 
from Software Test Engineer to Senior Software Engineer. I have worked on projects such as Subnautica: Below Zero, Hearthstone and Darkest Dungeon 2.
I have a passion for automating systems and reducing bottlenecks in developer and tester workflows. I also have a love for game design and frequently 
prototype new and wacky ideas in my free time. You can see some of my projects on this website.</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to play video games, play ice hockey, and to spend time with wife and daughter
